  @brief A property of mixed streams which distinguishes them from other mixed
  streams a conference room provides.
  @details A conference room, since Intel CS for WebRTC v3.4 and later, has been
  extended to support multiple presentations of the mixed audio and video for
  variant purposes. For example, in remote education scenario, the teacher and
  students may subscribe different mixed streams with view of 'teacher' and
  'student' respectively in the same class conference room. It is also the label
  of a mixed stream indicating its peculiarity with a meaningful string-typed
  value, which must be unique within a room.
