# Open Media Streamer Native SDK

## Introduction
Open Media Streamer client SDK for native Windows/Linux/iOS applications are built upon the W3C WebRTC standard to accelerate the development of real time communication applications on these platforms. It supports peer to peer and conference mode communication working with Open Media Stream MCU server.

- Supported Windows platform: Windows 7 and above.
- Supported Linux platform: Ubuntu 16.04.
- Supported iOS platform: iOS 9.0 and above.

## Documentation
To generate the API document, go to scripts directory, and run `python build-win.py --docs` for Windows or `./gendoc.sh` in `talk/oms/docs/ios` for iOS.

You need [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) in your path.

## How to build

### Build Windows SDK

### Prepare the development environment
Before you start, make sure you have following prerequisites installed/built:

- [WebRTC stack build dependencies](https://webrtc.org/native-code/development/prerequisite-sw/).
- [OpenSSL 1.1.0](https://www.openssl.org/source/).

Following dependencies are for Windows only:

- [Boost 1.67.0 or higher](https://www.boost.org/users/download/).
- [Intel Media SDK for Windows, version 2018 R1 or higher](https://software.intel.com/en-us/media-sdk/choose-download/client).

### Get the code
- Make sure you clone the source code to `src` dir.
- Create file named .gclient under the same directory of `src` dir, with below contents:

```
solutions = [ 
  {  
     "managed": False,  
     "name": "src",  
     "url": "https://github.com/open-media-streamer/oms-client-native.git",  
     "custom_deps": {},  
     "deps_file": "DEPS",  
     "safesync_url": "",  
  },  
]  
target_os = []  
```

### Build
#### Windows
- Set environmental variable ````BOOST_ROOT```` to your boost source tree, and ````SSL_ROOT```` to the directory of your OpenSSL 1.1.0 binary.
- Go to src/srcitps/ directory, and run: ```` python build-win.py --sdk --tests```` The built binary will be under src/dist directory. Be noted the first time you run this would take a long time to pull chromium/webrtc dependencies and require a network accessible to Google's code/storage infrastructure.

#### iOS
- Run `gclient sync`. It may take a long time to download large amount of data.
- Build OMS iOS SDK with `scripts\build.py`.

#### Android
- Replace the last line of `.gclient` with `target_os=["android"]`
- Run `gclient sync`. It may take a long time to download large amount of data.
- Build libwebrtc for OMS Android SDK with `scripts/build_android.py`.
